# Jumper

A different version of hangman. A man has jumped off of a plan and the integrity of his parachute depends on his ability to guess, correctly, what word matches the number of empty spaces. The goal is to make it to the ground with his parachute intact. Each incorrect guess results in the departure of a portion of his parachute. When the words has been guessed correctly or there is no more parachute to lose, the game is over.
